Your chao’s grades are very important in <a href="compete.php" class="contact">Competitions</a>. You can check your grades at the Doctor’s office (see <a href="kindergarten.php" class="contact">Chao Kindergarten</a>.) Ask for the Medical Chart. It looks like the chart to the right.
</p>

<p>Grades determine how much an animal/chaos drive/fruit will raise the Skill Point. The higher the grade, the more skill points can be gained once your chao increases a level. There are 6 different grades, E, D, C, B, A, and S. The easiest and most common S to get is in stamina.
</p>

<p>There is a range of points you will get for each Skill Level. Here they are.
</p>


<p>S | +26, +27, +28, +29, +30 <br>
A | +23, +24, +25, +26, +27 <br>
B | +20, +21, +22, +23, +24 <br>
C | +17, +18, +19, +20, +21 <br>
D | +14, +15, +16, +17, +18 <br>
E | +11, +12, +13, +14, +15 <br>
</p>

<p>The Chao can improve their grades by geneology. If one parent was an S-rank in Flying and the other was a B-rank flying, they will automatically inherit the highest rank.
