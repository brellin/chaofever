        <h2>The Angel Chao</h2>

        <p>
            Follow the first two steps of making a Light Chao. (Reincarnate it at least twice and give it one of every animal - NO CHAOS DRIVES!)
        </p>

        <p>
            Note: When making an Angel Chao, make sure it is on the Hero side for evolution by using Hero character to look after it.

        <p>
            When it evolves it will be a Angel Chao!
