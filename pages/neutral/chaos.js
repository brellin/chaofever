        <h2>The Light Chao</h2>

        <p>
            First of all, you must reincarnate your Chao at least twice. When this is done, you must then give the Chao ONE of EVERY animal (Yes, all 21 animals - NO CHAOS DRIVES).
        </p>

        <p>
            Note: When making a Light Chao, make sure it stays neutral for evolution by using a mixture of Hero and Dark characters to care for it.
        </p>

        <p>
            When it evolves it will be a Light Chao!
