<p>-Black Market-</p>

<p>The Black Market is located in the Chao Kindergarden on the lower left corner. From the out side it looks like a locker, but when you enter you will see something like the picture above. You will have three options, "Shopping" which lets you buy items such as hats, eggs, and fruit, with the rings you collect thoughout each level. The next option is "Sell Items" selling items lets you sell things like, egg shells, hats, fruit (note: if you bout a hat at the black market and tried to sell it back to them you will get less than what you payed for.) The last opition is pretty much self explanitory "Back" leads you back to the lobby of the Chao Kindergarden. 
</p>
<p>-Classroom-</p>

<p>The Classroom is the room loacted in the Chao Kindergarden next to the Black Market. From the out site it is just an ordinary door. When you enter it will look like the picture above ecept there are four things to read "Today's Lesson" means what your chao will be learning in this case according to the picture above your chao will learn the Drums. Once in a while you might see your chao playing the drums in your chao garden. The next option is "Leave Chao" that lets you leave you chao to learn the current lesson being tought. (Note: You will have to wait10 minutes for your chao to finish it's lesson. The next option is "Take Chao" that lets you take you chao WHEN he is finished with his lesson. The last opition is again pretty much self explanitory "Back" leads you back to the lobby of the Chao Kindergarden. 
Also here is a list of all the activities your chao can learn:

<p>-Principal-</p>

<p>Now for the Principal. The Principal is located in the Chao Kindergarden just right of the Classroom. The Principal is the gray chao in the back, but it's the professor who does all of the talking. He isn't really helpfull to someone experienced with chao. 
</p>
<p>-Heath Center-</p>

<p>The Health center is located in the Chao Kindergarden just right of the Principal. The Health Center is by far one of the more important sections. The first option it gives you is to check your chao's health. If your chao is sick he will give you medicine. 
</p>
<p>The next option is to check your chao's stats. It will tell you if he is neutral, hero, or dark. It will tell what stage of his life he is in. It will also tell you his stats in each catagory. You will see his swim, fly, run, power, and stamina grades (note: grades vary from E being the worst, D, C, B, A, and S being the best) 
</p>
<p>The Next thing will tell you a little more about the chao itself than any of the above sections. It will tell you his Personality, Favorite Fruit, Age, how many times transformed, and it's current medical condition. 
</p>
<p>The Last thing the Health center can do for you is tell show you how many race medals your chao has won, and it's win to lose ratio in chao karate. To learn more about chao Karate and Chao race visit Chao Stadium 
</p>
<p>-Fortune Teller-</p>

<p>The Fortune teller is located in the Chao Kindergarden at the top right hand corner. Now the Fortune Teller does not actually tell your chao's fortune she just names you chao for you, but if you would like to name your chao yourself reject the name she offers you. She then will ask you if you would like a different name, say no. Then she'll ask if you want to name your chao yourself and the screen will look like the picture bellow.
