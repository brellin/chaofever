<ul>
<li>Never Ever hit or attack a Chao 

<li>Never throw your chao around. 

<li>Pet your chao every once in a while 

<li>Do not pet a chao too much or it will become spoiled! This is something you do NOT want! 

<li>Feed your chao by hand until he is full ONLY when he is in childhood. Doing that after evolution can spoil the chao 

<li>If a Chao is skipping or running towards you(It likes the character you're using alot) pet it ONLY ONCE. 


<li>And for every good deed there is a reward. Be nice to your chao and when they will reincarnate when they die.
